# OFFUTURE Performance Analysis (2011-2015)

## Project Purpose:
This project was a proof-of-concept descriptive analysis for **Offuture**, a global online office supplies retailer. The goal was to validate our consultancy's accuracy and trustworthiness by analyzing their sales data from 2011-2015, following a previous consultant's erroneous report. Our team, **10acious Solutions**, conducted a full analysis to provide clear, data-driven insights into the company's performance.

## Project Overview:
- **Analyze the Data:** Performed SQL-based analysis on a multi-table relational database to understand company performance.
- **Visualization & Storytelling:** Transformed complex data into intuitive Tableau dashboards to communicate key findings.
- **Present:** Delivered a cohesive presentation to the client, outlining performance trends and strategic insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL:** For data extraction, transformation, and aggregation.
- **Tableau:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Presentation:** PDF/PowerPoint for client-facing reporting.
